This repository contains the programs and data inputs for the models developed as part of the project “Optimizing Service Areas to Reduce Congestion and Enhance Equity in Access to Transportation Systems”, which is funded by the National Institute of Congestion Reduction. The programs and data inputs contained here were used in the research discussed in the paper “Joint optimization of fixed route bus networks and complementary paratransit service areas”. 

The programs and their descriptions are a work in progress. Let us know if you found a bug or have any questions.  

To find the parameters used in the paper, see the scripts **gen_transit_param.py** and **gen_ga_param.py**. 

The master script that runs the simulations is called **integrated_model.py**.
